ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard Project

Project Overview

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard that transformed raw transactional data into business insights. This project involved creating data models, managing relationships, and designing visuals to present key business metrics clearly and effectively.

ðŸš² Chicago Bike Share Monthly Data Overview (April 2023 â€“ March 2024)
This dataset consists of detailed bike-share trip records spanning 12 monthly CSV files, capturing Chicagoâ€™s urban mobility patterns from April 2023 through March 2024.

Dataset Highlights:

12 CSV files, each representing a monthâ€™s worth of trip data.

Trip-level records including ride_id, rideable_type (electric/classic/docked), and timestamps for trip start (started_at) and end (ended_at).

Geospatial details including start and end station names and IDs, along with latitude and longitude coordinates for both start and end points.

User classification into member or casual riders, enabling behavioral segmentation.

Key Columns and Their Purpose:

ride_id: Unique identifier for each trip.

rideable_type: Bike type used â€” electric, classic, or docked.

started_at, ended_at: Date and time markers for trip duration analysis.

start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id: Origin and destination information.

start_latitude, start_longitude, end_latitude, end_longitude: Precise geospatial mapping data.

member_casual: Rider category for understanding usage demographics.

Power BI Technique used

Data Modeling : Defined relationships between multiple tables using keys

DAX Measures : Created measuers like Distance travelled (Kms and Miles), Time taken (mins)

Visuals used : Bar chart, KPIC cards, slicers, maps and filters

Visualised Metrics
